# Online Examination System

## üîñ Project Title & Description
**Project Title:** Online Examination System  

**Description:**  
This project is a full-stack Online Examination System designed for educational institutions. It allows administrators and examiners to create, manage, and assign exams, create students while students (examinees) can login, manage thier account, and take exams, and view results.  

**Purpose & Audience:**  
- **Who it‚Äôs for:** Schools, universities, training centers, and online education platforms.  
- **Why it matters:** Automates the exam process, ensures fair and efficient assessment, and provides real-time analytics on student performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Backend:**  
- Python 3.x  
- Django 5.2.6  
- Django REST Framework (DRF)  
- djangorestframework-simplejwt (JWT authentication)  
- MySQL (via Supabase)  
- python-dotenv (environment variable management)  
- django-cors-headers (CORS support for React frontend)  

**Frontend:**  
- React.js (npm)  
- Axios (API calls)  
- React Router (client-side routing)  
- JWT-based authentication  
- CSS / Tailwind /

**Development Tools:**  
- Git & GitHub (version control)  
- Cursor ai IDE (IDE)  
- curl (API testing)

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

**1. Code Generation:**  
- Use AI IDE agents (Cursor and Trae, and gemini cli) to scaffold backend and frontend components.  
- Generate boilerplate code for models, serializers, API endpoints, React components, and services.  
- Suggest project structure improvements, file organization, and coding best practices.  

**2. Testing:**  
- Leverage AI to create **unit tests** for Django models and API endpoints.  
- Generate **integration tests** for end-to-end exam submission and grading flows.  
- Use prompts to validate test coverage and suggest edge cases.  

**3. Documentation:**  
- AI-assisted generation of docstrings for Python classes, functions, and methods.  
- Inline comments in React components to describe logic and API integration.  
- Maintain README, setup guides, and environment instructions with AI-generated templates.  

**4. Context-aware Techniques:**  
- Feed AI agents **file trees, API specs, or Git diffs** to generate context-aware code suggestions.  
- Use AI to refactor code based on current project state, ensuring consistent coding patterns.  
- Enable incremental updates and scaffolding for new features without breaking existing functionality.

## ‚ö° Next Steps

1. Setup Django REST backend and connect to MySQL (Supabase).  
2. Scaffold React frontend with JWT authentication.  
3. Implement exam creation, question management, and exam-taking flows.  
4. Add auto-grading for MCQs and manual grading for essays.  
5. Integrate AI-assisted testing and documentation.  
6. Deploy backend (e.g., Render / Railway) and frontend (e.g., Netlify / Vercel).
